# Order-Prediction
This project is a machine learning pipeline for predicting order completion time using Gradient Boosting Regression. The dataset appears to be an E-commerce transactions dataset, where various factors (such as product details, payment methods, and customer information) are used to predict how long an order will take to be delivered.
